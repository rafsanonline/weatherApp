## Introduction
Weather App

This is a simple application for fetching current weather data from OpenWeatherMap. Users can easily obtain current weather updates upon entering the app. Additionally, it offers the capability to retrieve data from any city or state worldwide through its search feature.

## App Structure
I've implemented a clean architecture with the MVVM design pattern to develop this application, leveraging the latest Android Jetpack Components. The main components of the app include:

Jetpack Compose  
ViewModel  
Hilt  
Flow  
Kotlin Coroutines  
Retrofit
